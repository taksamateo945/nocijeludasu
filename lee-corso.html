And in 1962, Corso took Nugent’s advice and hired an academic. Darryl Hill was also persuaded to transfer from the Naval Academy by an athletically qualified black player. As a result, he became the Atlantic Coast Conference’s first African-American football player. Finally, in 1966, he was hired as the Navy’s defensive backs coach. In addition, in 1969, he was named head coach at Louisville, where he coached his ESPN colleague Tom Jackson.</p><p>As a result, in 1970, after leading Louisville to its second-ever bowl game. As a result, he was hired by Indiana in 1972. He coached at Indiana from 1973 to 1982, leading the Hoosiers to two winning seasons in 1979 and 1980. The 1979 season ended with a record of 7–4. As a result, they were invited to the 1979 Holiday Bowl. Indiana’s victory over the Cougars propelled the team to 16th in the UPI poll. The Hoosiers’ first top-20 ranking since 1967.</p><p>In the 1976 season, he was called out after his team scored a touchdown early in the second quarter. It also said: Indiana 7, Ohio State 6. It was the first time in five years that the Hoosiers had led the Buckeyes in a football game. Meanwhile, during his ten years at Indiana, his record was 41–68–2. He was the 16th head football coach at Northern Illinois University. His record as the head coach of Northern Illinois was 4–6–1.</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>Finally, in 1985, Lee Corso made his professional debut as a coach with the Orlando Renegades Football League (USFL). He was planning to return to the Renegades in the fall of 1986. The league eventually suspended operations prior to the start of the season, never to return. ESPN hired him in 1987 as an analyst for its Saturday College GameDay program. In addition, he frequently serves as a comic foil to co-hosts Rece Davis, Desmond Howard, and Kirk Herbstreit. As a result, they cover major college football games from August to January.</p><p>Similarly, he refers to nearly everyone as “sweetheart.” It began on October 5, 1996, prior to the Ohio State-Penn State game in Columbus, Ohio. During that time, he came up with the idea of donning the OSU “Brutus Buckey.” On November 1, 2014, he made his 250th headgear selection, TCU’s Super Frog, before the TCU-WVU game.</p><p>In a Nike commercial from 2006, he makes a brief cameo appearance alongside the fictional Briscoe High School football team. Michael Vick, Troy Polamalu, LaDainian Tomlinson, Brian Urlacher, and others played it. He and Herbstreit both appeared in EA Sports’ NCAA Football games on a yearly basis. Thus, until NCAA Football 11, it was play-by-play man Brad Nessler. Similarly, in the 2006 edition of the game, his mascot headgear prediction starts with him.</p><h2>Lee Corso Wife, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Lee Corso</strong> married Betsy Youngblood in 1956, and they have been together ever since.
