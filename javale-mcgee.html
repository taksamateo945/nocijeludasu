JaVale is now a new member of the Los Angeles Lakers. He raises around $2.3 million a year there. Furthermore, he is the landlord of a $2.425 million home. In 2015, he repurchased the property.</p><h2>Professional Life & Career</h2><p>McGee was initially selected eighteenth overall by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. On July 9, 2008, he agreed to terms with the Wizards on a two-year, $2.4 million extension. The Wizards fined McGee $10,000 for his involvement in Gilbert Arenas’ shenanigans on January 9, 2010, prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 5, 2010. McGee was able to compete in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest on January 6, 2011. McGee was the first Wizard to take part in the case. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Blake Griffin. McGee was also the first player in a dunk contest to use three balls at the same time. Guinness World Records have listed him as having the most basketballs dunked in one leap.</p><p>On March 15, 2011, the team was defeated by the Chicago Bulls, 98–79. His 12 blocks were the most in a single game since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, he received some criticism for taking ill-advised shots in the fourth quarter to ensure that he scored ten points as his team was getting blown out, and he even received a technical foul for unnecessary celebrating by pulling himself on the rim following a dunk for his final points. Kevin McHale, a TV analyst, called it a “evil triple-double.” McGee replied, “I got a triple-double.” Who would assert a triple-double? I’m not really concerned with it.” On October 14, 2011, after the NBA lockout, NBPA representatives met with approximately thirty players.</p><p>McGee left the meeting early and informed reporters that a couple of players were “saying they’re going to fold,” but the majority of them were united. Later, he denied, claiming the players were about to fold, but his remark was captured on tape by reporters. Based on the time he spent at the conference, Derek Fisher said that McGee had “no opportunity to make that point.” McGee was traded to the Nuggets along with Ronny Turiaf on March 15, 2012, as part of an exemption that sent Nenê to the Wizards. As a member of the Wizards, he started 40 of 41 games in which he appeared; as a member of the Nuggets, he started 5 of 20 games in which he appeared. On March 21, he made the game-winning dunk off an Arron Afflalo missed free throw with five seconds remaining in his Nuggets debut.</p><p>The Nuggets finished the regular season as the West’s sixth seed, and McGee appeared in the 2012 NBA Playoffs, his first playoff appearance in his career. McGee set a series record with 21 points in Game 5 against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. Throughout the series, McGee’s statistics fluctuated. McGee re-signed with the Nuggets on a four-year, $44 million deal on July 18, 2012. His 2013–14 season ended on February 20, 2014, after he underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left tibia on November 8, 2013. McGee returned for the Nuggets on October 29, 2014, and won against the Detroit Pistons.</p><p>McGee was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers on February 19, 2015, along with the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum and a 2015 first-round selection in return for the rights to Cenk Akyol. On March 1, 2015, he was refused by the 76ers after appearing in six games. He made a steal with the Dallas Mavericks on August 13, 2015. He was sidelined for the first 13 games of the 2015–16 season due to a stress fracture of his left tibia. In addition, on November 22, 2015, he made his Mavericks debut, appearing in just eleven minutes off the bench and scoring eight points and six rebounds in a defeat to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 5, 2016, he defeated the Sacramento Kings once more. On July 8, 2016, the Mavericks declined McGee.</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>Similarly, on September 16, 2016, McGee agreed to terms with the Golden State Warriors. On December 15, 2016, he won a game against the New York Knicks. In addition, on March 31, 2017, he defeated the Houston Rockets. Since defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, the Warriors won the 2017 NBA Championship. He appeared in 77 of the 82 regular-season contests. On August 1, 2017, McGee re-signed a one-year extension with the Warriors. As he returned to the starting lineup after the all-star break, his playing time increased. In June 2018, he claimed his second consecutive championship after the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in a four-game series in the Finals. He started the final three games of the series and finished with 8.0 points.</p><p>On July 10, 2018, McGee agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Lakers. He missed seven games in December due to a respiratory issue. He was defeated by the Brooklyn Nets on March 22, 2019. In addition, on November 23, 2020, JaVale was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell. McGee was invited to the United States men’s national basketball team’s minicamp in both the summers of 2009 and 2010. McGee participated in a scrimmage with Team USA at Radio City Music Hall during the 2010 World Basketball Festival, but due to an uneven performance, he did not appear in the team’s scrimmage against China at Madison Square Garden. It came to an end on August 15, 2010.</p><p>During the 2011 NBA lockout, McGee visited the Philippines twice, first for exhibition games with NBA stars versus teams from the Philippine Basketball Association and the Smart Gilas national team, and then for a basketball clinic. Later that year, he expressed interest in playing for the Philippine national team. In 2012, a bill was introduced to grant him Filipino citizenship, allowing him to compete for Smart Gilas. Furthermore, McGee was asked to participate as a naturalized player in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain by the Gilas Pilipinas. However, each national party was reduced to one naturalized player, and a Wizards member, Andray Blatche, made the World Cup group after being granted citizenship.</p><h2>JaVale McGee Girlfriend & Dating</h2><p><b>Who is JaVale McGee’s Girlfriend?</b><span> JaVale McGee is dating Giselle Ramirez.
