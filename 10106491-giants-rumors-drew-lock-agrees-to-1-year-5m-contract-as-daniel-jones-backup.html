At the time, it looked like the 2019 second-round pick would have an opportunity to kick-start his career after a disappointing start in the Mile High City.</p><p>But Geno Smith proceeded to not only win the starting job but also far exceeded everyone's expectations. He won Comeback Player of the Year, and his performance netted him a <a href=# rel=noopener>three-year, $75 million</a> extension.</p><p>That left Lock once again on the outside looking in.</p><p>A groin injury to Smith did at least allow the 6'4" signal-caller to make a pair of starts late into the year. He combined to go 44-of-64 for 477 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions as the Seahawks split their Weeks 14 and 15 contests with the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>The <i>Seattle Times</i>' <a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Condotta</a> laid out the dilemma for Lock, writing he "said after the season he'd like to be back but also would like to play." A new coach presented another wrinkle since Carroll's replacement inevitably had much less invested in Lock's development.</p><p>Lock's one full season as a starter for the Broncos was pretty rough. He threw for 2,933 yards, 16 touchdowns and an NFL-high 15 interceptions in 13 appearances, and his 41.2 QBR <a href=# rel=noopener>ranked 29th</a> among qualified passers.</p><p>His two-game cameo with Seattle in 2023 was a slight improvement, though.</p><p>A survey of the <a href=# rel=noopener>backup QBs</a> from last year points to how tough it is to find someone you'd trust to run an offense in an emergency situation. The Minnesota Vikings cycled through three different options (Joshua Dobbs, Nick Mullens and Jaren Hall) after Kirk Cousins, and none proved to be a viable solution over time.</p><p>The thing with Lock is that in a perfect world he won't even see the field for New York in 2024 because that will have meant Jones stayed healthy and productive. Should his services be required, he will be able to hold things down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGuBen2MoKCapqSoerPBzKiprGWUp7K4ecuomqRlkZy%2FprHSZquoZWFixqat0WZspmWTpLu1vsCcq2aZo2KxorrInqNmop%2BjsrR5wZqapK2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
