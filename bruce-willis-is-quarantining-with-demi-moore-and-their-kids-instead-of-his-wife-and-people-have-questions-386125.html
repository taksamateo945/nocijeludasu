It’s also caused a number of celebrity exes to choose to hole up together inside their California homes — a move that has baffled many common folks around the world. Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson put aside their differences and are self-isolating together (they will celebrate True Thompson’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second birthday</a> and Easter together) and now Bruce Willis and ex-wife Demi Moore are the next celebrity exes to shack up together during the Coronavirus pandemic. No one outside of their immediate family seems to know why Demi and Bruce are going through the pandemic together — especially when he is married to Emma Heming and they have two young daughters together.</p><p>There are many fan theories circulating social media as people try to figure out why Bruce is with Demi and some have even wondered if Bruce and Emma have an open marriage that includes Demi!</p><p>Some have suggested that maybe someone in Demi’s household had been exposed to the deadly Coronavirus making it dangerous for Bruce to spend time with Emma and their girls (Evelyn (5) and Mabel (8).&nbsp; Bruce and Demi have three adult daughters together: Rumer (31), Scout (28), and Tallulah (26).</p><p>Still, people are amazed that Bruce is spending the lockdown with his first wife and not Emma and the girls. Bruce Willis is 65-years-old and Demi Moore is 57-years-old. He is also at the age where he could suffer complications were he to get the virus.</p><p>Also staying with Bruce and Demi are Scout and Tallulah, Rumer wasn’t seen in a family photo where they were all wearing matching green and white striped pajamas by Leveret.</p><p>You may see a group photo that Demi Moore shared on her official Instagram account below. She captioned the photo with “family bonding” which even caused more questions since Bruce Willis was prominently featured in the photo.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-r5aRlngVw/</p><p>What do you think about Bruce Willis spending the Coronavirus pandemic in lockdown with his ex-wife Demi Moore?</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you agree with those who think it sounds odd?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp8KksYywoKWkmah6qr%2BMqqyaqpGjwaq6yKeeZq%2BZqbVusMSmoGaln6S%2FpnnAp5tmrJiatrN5yqKbrGWZo8C1scCdZKieXZ22tHnWop2eZZGjsW68xKinpZ1dna63sYyqrJ6rpJ68r7%2BMbG9vaWJqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
