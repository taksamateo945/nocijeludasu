His first work was the 1993 movie, Wilder Napalm which starred <strong>Dennis Quaid</strong> and <strong>Debra Winger</strong>.</p><p>Gilligan was then involved in the making of Home Fries, which had <strong>Drew Barrymore</strong>, <strong>Luke Wilson</strong>, and <strong>Catherine O’Hara</strong> playing lead roles. Vince had written the script while he was enrolled at Tisch School of Arts and even won the 1989 Virginia Governor’s Screenwriting Award.</p><p>Furthermore, Vince also worked on movies like A.M.P.E.D., Hancock, and Pulse, all of which did well financially. And given below are the box-office collection of films that Vince Gilligan worked on:</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Movies</th><th>Box-office Collection</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Wilder Napalm</td><td>$56.2K</td></tr><tr><td>Home Fries</td><td>$10.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Pulse</td><td>$20.3 million</td></tr><tr><td>Hancock</td><td>$227.9 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Along with movies, Gilligan also worked as a writer for the hit tv show, The X-Files. He had been a big fan of the show and submitted his script to Fox, which later became the 23rd episode of the series’ second season. Vince went on to work on 29 more episodes and was also the co-executive producer, producer, supervising producer, and co-producer of many episodes.</p><p>Moreover, he was the executive producer and co-creator of the spin-off series, The Lone Gunmen. However, this show did not receive similar reception and only ran for a season. Despite this setback, Vince must have been paid handsomely for his work. Also, having adopted various roles in The X-Files, he must have received a considerable sum benefitting Vince Gilligan’s net worth.</p><p>In addition to working on various projects in the Breaking Bad franchise, he has been involved in shows like Metastasis, Battle Creek, Harsh Realm, and Night Stalker. He has also tried his hand in acting and starred in a single episode of the series Community, Comedy Bang! Bang!, Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero and American Dad!.</p><p>With the multi-talented artist covering such varied roles on the aforementioned shows and movies, it is no surprise that Vince Gilligan’s net worth is in millions. And the massive fortune has helped Vince enjoy a lavish lifestyle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia_And_Facts></span>Trivia And Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Vince Gilligan was born in Richmond, Virginia, on 10th February 1967.</li><li>Gilligan has been in a relationship with his girlfriend, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Holly Rice</strong></a>, since 1991.</li><li>His girlfriend is frequently referenced in his works.</li></ul><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & T.V.
