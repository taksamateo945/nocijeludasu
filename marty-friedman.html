Self-taught musician who was leader and rhythm guitarist of Megadeth, a heavy metal group. Megadeth for more than 10 years.</p><p>He was a guest in the Japanese television drama The Quiz Show, featuring&nbsp;He guest-starred on the Japanese TV drama, The Quiz Show, featuring <a href=#>Sho Sakurai</a>…</p><p>At the age of 14, after attending a KISS concert, Friedman took up the guitar, and is largely self-taught. He rushed to form a band and started playing original songs, the reason being that originals are easier to play than covers. “Because,” he says, “even if you screw up, you just claim that the song is written like that and no one can challenge you.” The mother of one of Marty’s friends ran an event center with a two-level stage, and Marty and his friends used it as a rehearsal space. Soon word spread about their band, and, since they were in a rural area, people would come from miles around to socialize and listen to music. “Rehearsals” very quickly became live shows. Friedman formed and played lead guitar in several other bands, including Deuce, Hawaii (which had previously been called Vixen), and notably Cacophony. Cacophony featured neoclassical metal elements and synchronized twin guitar harmonies and counterpoints shared with guitarist Jason Becker. He played guitar on the 1987 album It Won’t Be Long by Christian rock band Shout. In 1988, he recorded demos for Jet Red that eventually were released as bonus tracks on the 2009 Jet Red release “Flight Plan”. In August 1988, he released his first solo album, Dragon’s Kiss.</p><p>When Cacophony disbanded in 1989, Friedman auditioned for the thrash metal band Megadeth after a tip from his friend Bob Nalbandian, Friedman officially joined Megadeth in February 1990. Friedman’s audition can be seen on the Megadeth DVD Arsenal of Megadeth. The first album he recorded with them was Rust in Peace which was released on September 24, 1990. Rust in Peace was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1994 and was nominated for the Best Metal Performance Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards.</p><p align=justify>He got married to with a Japanese cellist in 2012.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marty Friedman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Friedman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington, D.C.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hiyori Okuda</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Marty Friedman ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In July 1992, Megadeth released Countdown to Extinction, which was a more commercial album, aimed at a wider audience, and sold double platinum. Friedman played on Megadeth’s further releases Youthanasia (1994), Cryptic Writings (1997), and Risk (1999). After a total of five studio albums with Megadeth, in December 1999 Friedman announced his departure from Megadeth. His last show with them was on January 14, 2000. Friedman later stated that he got tired of “holding the flag” for traditional metal and felt that he could not evolve as a musician.
