She is the daughter of a former football player, John Reaves.</p><p>Similarly, Kiffin’s father played in the NFL for 11 seasons. During his prime, Lane played for teams such as the Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The information about her mother is being kept under wraps.</p><p>Her mother divorced her father, and he raised their three children on his own. Similarly, Kiffin grew up with two brothers named Stephen and David Reaves. Aside from their names, their current location is unknown. Leaving that aside, Layla is an American citizen of white ethnic origin.</p><h2>Layla Kiffin Education</h2><p>Layla spent the majority of her childhood in Florida because she was born and raised there. Buchholz High School was where she finished her primary and secondary education.</p><p>Kiffin grew up in a sports-loving family and was heavily involved in sports throughout her childhood. She attended the University of Florida after graduating from high school and received her degree in 1996.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>In terms of her career, the well-known social media personality has made no mention of it. Aside from being a social media personality thanks to her husband’s fame, there is not much information telling about Layla’s profession or job.</p><p>Moreover, she went silent after her divorce from Lane. It is mentioned that after the divorce, Kiffin received more than 34.5 percent of her husband’s earnings.</p><h2>Layla Kiffin Husband, Marriage</h2><p>There is no doubt or question on how Kiffin got her fame and started in social media. As we all know, Layla was married to a former football player, Lane Kiffin, who is now active as a coach.</p><p>Looking back at their relationship, the two met for the first time in 1999 and instantly fell in love. After that, they kept meeting and seeing each other, further strengthening their relationships.</p><p>Finally, after a year of dating, the two tied the knot in a beautiful wedding ceremony held in 2000. Public yet intimate, their wedding was attended by their close friends and families, and however, every people knew about it.</p><p>During that time, Lane was active as a graduate assistant at Colorado State. The star’s husband, Lane, was born Lane Monte Kiffin on May 9, 1975. Slowly, the young star made his way up as the University of Alabama’s offensive coordinator, along with his duties in the USC Trojans football.</p><p>Likewise, Lane was also the head coach of the University of Tennessee Volunteers, Oakland Raiders. But as of now, the famous football star is handling his role as the head coach of the Florida Atlantic University.</p><p>Despite his hectic schedule and frequent traveling, Layla always stayed by her husband’s side. Rather than enjoying the fame and getting lost in it, Kiffin was the type to follow the shadows of her husband.</p><p>Furthermore, from their relationship, the two gave birth to three children. Layla gave birth to Landry, their eldest daughter, in 2005. After two years, their second child, Pressley, was born. Not to mention, the happy family welcomed another member to theirs in 2009. Layla gave birth to her third child and named him Monte Knox Kiffin, talking their number to five.</p><p>Looking back at it, the small Kiffin family looked happy and out of trouble. Lane was successful and financially supporting his small family while Layla, being a good wife, took of her children and husband. However, there is so much that the eyes can not see. With the growing fame, the family became the target of paparazzi and media. Not to mention, various allegations and rumors started sprouting about Lane.</p><p>Formerly, the father of three kids, Lane, was rumored to be having an affair with some unknown high-profile lady from Alabama. But the rumors died down without any proof. However, the next time, it did not go so well from star Lane. This time, he was again linked with Nick Saban‘s daughter, Kristen Saban, and they were rumored to be having a relationship.</p><p>At that time, Nick was the head coach while Lane worked as an offensive coordinator for the Alabama Crimson Tide football. Just like his previous allegations, this also lacked evidence, and it is still unclear if it had anything with their divorce or not.</p><p>Soon after this, Layla filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Then in March of 2016, both of them agreed to get separated while still taking responsibility for their kids.</p><p>Since then, Layla has stayed away from media as far as possible. Also, from the looks of it, she is still single and has not dated anyone.</p><h2>Layla Kiffin’s Net Worth</h2><p>It is no hiding that Layla is no professional work and has no job that indicates her yearly income. Since most of her fame comes from her husband’s influence, there is not much to say about her that.</p><p>But after the divorce, it seems she has become $250k richer. Yes, as September 2023, Kiffin’s net worth is assumed to be $250k. Also, it is mentioned that Layla and her three kids live in a rented house on Manhattan Beach that costs $10,000 each month.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmrGclnqstcWfoKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
