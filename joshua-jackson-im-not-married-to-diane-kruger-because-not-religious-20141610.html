The Affair actor explains in <a href=# rel=noopener>Glamour's</a> upcoming November issue why he and his longtime love, actress <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Diane Kruger</strong></a>, haven't walked down the aisle yet.</p><p>"I can tell you why we're not married: We're not religious. I don't feel any more or less committed to Diane for not having stood in front of a priest and had a giant party," Jackson, 36, tells the mag. "We're both children of divorce, so it's hard for me to take marriage at face value as the thing that shows you've grown up and are committed to another person. But it may change at some point. We may get married."</p><p>The Dawson's Creek alum shared the same sentiment to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at Montblanc's 24 Hour Plays in L.A. back in June 2012. "Marriage is important for the people it's important for, but neither one of us is particularly religious, so I don't think there's any particular push," <a href=# rel=noopener>he told <strong>Us</strong> at the time.</a> "But never say never! I don't know."</p><p>Jackson and the Bridge actress, 38, began dating in 2006. Kruger, who was married to actor <strong>Guillaume Canet</strong> from 2001 to 2006, noted that her divorce helped her learn that she doesn't believe in marriage. "I believe in a commitment that you make in your heart. There's no paper that will make you stay," she told Glamour in February 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>This past June, <a href=# rel=noopener>she added to Metro</a> that she doesn't "intend" to wed. She said: "I never believed in love at first sight but I do believe opposites attract."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, that seems to be the case with Jackson, especially in regards to his fashion sense. "[If] you want to be respected as a grown-up, you have to dress like one," Jackson told Glamour of what Kruger has taught him about fashion. "I used to have a collection of Adidas <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>, but one day all the obnoxiously colored ones disappeared. She still claims I must have lost them 'somewhere.'"</p><p>Marriage may not be on the table right now, but parenthood is. In 2012, Jackson told <strong>Us</strong> he'd love to be a father one day. "I mean, I'm at that age," he said.</p><p>He's also old enough where his friends' kids now watch reruns of his Pacey Witter days. "If I'm somewhere cold, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mighty Ducks.</a> Anywhere else, Dawson's," he told Glamour of what role he gets recognized for most. "I'm now at an age where my friends’ kids like Dawson's…but they like it ironically."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGoq5iqrm62wJyirKeeYrauec2oq2alkae%2FqrHDZquoZZSerq%2BxjKSprp%2BVp3qjscKarKydXaO8tXnRnqOin5mkwrR5kWlobWlmZn0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
