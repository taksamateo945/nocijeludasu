To celebrate this, we’ve shared some reasons why we can’t help but love Sarah Close!</p><h3>5. Her Singing Your Questions Videos</h3><p>In 2014, Sarah uploaded her first ever ‘Singing Your Questions’ video onto YouTube. In this video, Sarah sang questions and answers to&nbsp;which she had been asked. The opening question&nbsp;was “Will you marry me?”, Sarah’s answer&nbsp;was “Well, I’m only 18 so, ask again when I’m 23”. We are all still waiting for the day that Sarah turns 23 to see what her answer will be. This is the first of four in the series and Saz has hinted that the fifth one is coming very soon! We are very excited for the fifth video to be released, you can take a look back at her first video here.</p><p></p><h3>4. Her Kindness to Fans</h3><p>Sarah has been growing rapidly on YouTube recently and this means that more people are getting to know the kind person that she is. Every day Sarah takes time to reply and talk to the people who support her in all that she does, even when she is on holiday or in the studio. Whether it’s a Tweet, a message or talking to people through other social media accounts, she never fails to acknowledge the people who have helped her grow on YouTube!</p><h3>3. Her Taste of Music</h3><p>Whilst scrolling through Sarah’s videos on YouTube or her Spotify playlist, it’s very clear that Sarah Close has an great,&nbsp;and a very broad, taste in music. Ranging from Zara Larsson to Sam Smith, Catfish and the Bottlemen to Zayn, her music taste has no limits.</p><h3>2. Her Fashion Sense</h3><p>There is no doubt that Sarah has a great and unique fashion sense. From green stripy shorts to bright orange jumpers and gorgeous dresses, we can’t help but admire her for being so bold and outgoing. Her style is inspirational as she shows people not to be afraid&nbsp;of wearing bright or wacky clothing. She reminds us to be true to who we are.</p><h3>1. Her Singing</h3><p>How could we not adore Sarah’s excellent vocal ability? Ever since Sarah was a little girl, she has always wanted to be a singer. We can’t help but feel happy for her as her dreams become a reality. She is always working on her original songs&nbsp;and putting effort into each individual cover she does.&nbsp;We can’t help but admire her passion, and wish her nothing but the best!</p><p>We would like to wish Sarah the best of birthdays!</p><h4>What do you think of Sarah Close?
