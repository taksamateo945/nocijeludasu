"I think that left a little bit of a sour taste in all our mouths, the way we finished. But I mean, no, because I believe in the player I am. And now it feels good, and I knew they did already, that the organization believed in me.</p><p>"To put it out there, put it on paper, that I have the full faith and belief of the organization, for them to pay me like a top quarterback in the league, and to sign a long-term deal here, and put that faith and trust in me, feels really good. And to be backed by Mr. [Shad] Khan and Trent [Baalke] and Doug [Pederson] and all the people that are involved in making that decision, that feels as good as anything. Obviously, the money is awesome, too, but it's the respect, and feeling that I'm really backed by the team."</p><p>Lawrence threw for 4,016 passing yards, 21 touchdowns and 14 interceptionsâ€”all of those numbers worse than the 2022 season. Jacksonville also lost five of its last six games of the year to miss the playoffs.</p><p>Lawrence said the rocky third year was a season of learning and one that he thinks is crucial to have success in the NFL.</p><p>"I think that experience is probably the best teacher," Lawrence said. "Everyone says the big thing is the 'whys' learned from other people's mistakes. I do think that's true. But I also think there are some things you just kind of have to go through. And you learn a lot when you experience them. I've been through all the mixes. A terrible season. A season that started really bad and we finished really great, which was 2022. And last year was the opposite, started great and finished really bad."</p><p>Now that Lawrence has been paid like he's one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, he's looking to become one in his fourth season. Jacksonville has set him up for success after trading for wide receiver Gave Davis and drafting another receive in Brian Thomas Jr., so he could be in a good position to make a leap this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqFeoSMramerp%2Bneq2t1qucp5uVYrGmssSnm6xlmJ7AtbvRoppmopGcwqK%2B0maaqKakp66kwIyiZJudnJ6yt7GMoqVmrJiaerG4wLKcq2WZYq6u</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
