TV Guide reported “GH” executive producer, Gloria Monty, was casting someone charming who could also play a “Jekyll and Hyde”-style character — and she did.</p><p dir=ltr>According to the 1995 book, “General Hospital: The Complete Scrapbook,” in 1983, Celia (Sherilyn Wolter), who was a distant cousin to Lila Quartermaine (Anna Lee), arrived in Port Charles. Edward Quartermaine’s (David Lewis) illegitimate son, Jimmy Lee Holt (Steve Bond), was enamored with Celia. Although Celia spoke of her engagement to Dr. Grant Putnam, she couldn’t deny the attraction.</p><p dir=ltr>Jimmy Lee lived in an apartment above Kelly’s diner, where Celia also rented an art studio. Eventually, she agreed to sculpt him and they kissed. Although insisting that nothing was happening, Grant sensed the sexual tension between then and became jealous. At one point, he was on the phone with someone, saying that his marriage to Celia was “all set.” However, who was on the other end remained a mystery.</p><p dir=ltr>As Grant and Celia’s wedding day drew closer, he told her to break away from Jimmy Lee or the wedding was off. She assured him that their affair was over. Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary), on the heels of the Ice Princess story, was presumed killed in an avalanche. However, he had only been temporarily paralyzed, returning home after physical therapist, Natalie Dearborn (Melinda Cordell), helped him recover, per Scorpio Files.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaerTAzquwZqeWYrSmusSrmKVlmKTAsbXTmqOsZZmjwKK6xGatoqSclravecarmKesXaXCtbrApmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
