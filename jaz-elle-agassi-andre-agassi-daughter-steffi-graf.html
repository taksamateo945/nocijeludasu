Her full name is Jaz Elle Agassi. She is not the only kid in the family and has got an older sibling, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Jaden Agassi</a>.</strong></p><p>Even if Jaz Elle Agassi is a celebrity kid, many of you may not know her as compared to her parents. But don’t worry, just stick up with the article until the end to know a lot about Andre Agassi’s daughter, Jazz Agassi.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Andre_Agassis_daughter_Jaz_Elle_And_Her_Career></span>Andre Agassi’s daughter, Jaz Elle And Her Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born to tennis powerhouses, Jaz Agassi has tried her hand in Tennis, according to her parents. But like her brother, she hasn’t shown much inclination towards the sport. Jaz’s mother, Steffi Graf, said in an interview that Jaz competed in horse jumping when she was younger.</p><p>But unfortunately, due to an accident where she nearly eluded a severe injury, she stopped. Now, Jaz more or less rides just for enjoyment. Steffi also said that Jaz was more involved in hip-hop dance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Jaz-Elle-1-1.jpg><p>The former tennis legends revealed that they just want their children to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">choose as they see fit</a>. Well, looking at that, lovely Jaz Elle might be following her passion for bringing the best out of her. We wish good luck for whatever Jaz</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jaz_Elles_Personal_Life_Is_Very_Subtle></span>Jaz Elle’s Personal Life Is Very Subtle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The famous tennis duo hasn’t disclosed much information on the contemporary status of their daughter. She also seems to have <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">an Instagram account</a> that is, however, in private. Perhaps Jaz is the kind of person who loves privacy and secrecy.</p><p>Similar to her parents, Jaz Elle’s brother, Jaden Gil Agassi, is also building a career in an athletic background. But Jaz’s preference for any particulars at present is yet to be unveiled. Plus, her life is pretty much out of the reach of the media’s spectrum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Agassi-Family.jpg><p>Going through <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Andre Agassi’s Instagram</a>, we can see that he also barely posts his daughter’s photos. So, we can say that Jaz Elle is possibly happy with her low-profile and subtle life. Living a life far away from the spotlight and media most probably makes her feel alive.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Jaz_Elles_Parents_Meet></span>How Did Jaz Elle’s Parents Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eight-time&nbsp;Grand Slam&nbsp;champion, Andre Agassi, started dating Stefanie Graf, the winner of 22 Grand Slam singles titles after both won the French Open in 1999. Before that, Jaz Agassi’s father Andre, was married to actress <strong>Brooke Shields</strong>, but they divorced in 1999.</p><p>On October 22, 2001, at their&nbsp;Las Vegas&nbsp;home, Andre and Stefanie officially became husband and wife. Their mothers were the only witnesses at their union.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/andre-agassi-and-wife-steffi-graf.jpg><p>Even though the fame Jaz was born into, her parents have relatively managed to keep her life at the low. We value their choice to shield their daughter from the media highlight and wish the young Agassi success in any of her future endeavors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jaz_Elle_Agassi-_Name_Meaning></span>Jaz Elle Agassi- Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The name “Jaz” refers to ‘<strong>f</strong>ragrant flower.’ Similarly, Elle is a French pronoun, meaning ‘she.’</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a></strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaKGasl2aua2xjJqemqujnnqiusOrnGaZl5bAtLWMnZiun5ipsrN50q2cn56ZYrSzrcVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
