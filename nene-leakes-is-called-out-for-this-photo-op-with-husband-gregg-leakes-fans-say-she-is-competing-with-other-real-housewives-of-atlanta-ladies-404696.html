However, Gregg really felt he wanted to get out and try for a few and let everyone know that no matter what, we stand loud and proud! Black Lives Matter, and it has ALWAYS mattered. Thank you to everyone out here in the hot sun protesting daily! We love you and support you.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5ZKudAVLG/</p><p>She was slammed for the photo op, and for the fact that Gregg was not wearing a mask.</p><p>One critic stated: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt she say that before she posted about looters and being worried about her store?!

I‚Äôm confused. She literally mentioned the store as a point of reference to tell people where she was. And responded to a comment in her feed stating that‚Ä¶ I just think everyone is on high alert. At the EOD, she out there. Everything wrong be perfect for everyone‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs keep focus and the main thing the main thing. #blacklivesmatter‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJh6ONAhU3/</p><p>A third person revealed: ‚ÄúI feel like there‚Äôs some sort of competition she‚Äôs brewing of how much she has done for BLM vs. her castmates, and it‚Äôs seriously irrelevant and irritating.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CA0CUgigsSO/</p><p>This critic claimed: ‚ÄúCan y‚Äôall stay focused & leave this woman alone‚Ä¶ Damn‚Ä¶ This is getting ridiculous at this point‚Ä¶ Because she‚Äôs not the only one protesting‚Ä¶ But there are a lot of people being critical of her, but your life is in shambles or worse‚Ä¶ SMDH.‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Should the couple get any credit for doing this?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2K2tHnCmqOlnZRivLbAjJ%2Bmq2Wknba0ec%2Bhpq2nXaS9bsPIrZ9moKWor6K6w2aeq52XnHqtscCknKxllpa7tHnSmrBmq5iaeqq%2FjJympqiVqbavs4ywoK2gXaTBqbHRZqmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoyaq6WZnqmubrjAnaCeq11pfXWCmG9m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
