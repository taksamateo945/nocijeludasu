Golden took to Instagram on Wednesday (Aug. 31) to commemorate her “mini-me’s” special day.</p><p>“So THIS happened today,” Golden told <a href=# rel=noopener>her social media fans</a>. “It takes a village,” the actress exclaimed. “A pre-birthday celebration for my Dakota! 13 years old!”</p><p>Golden Brooks could not believe how big <a href=# rel=noopener>her daughter</a> has gotten over the years. “What,” the celebrity mom questioned. “My Baby girl is officially a teenager,” Brooks shared. The Girlfriends star told her social media fans her daughter celebrated her birthday “with her classmates and friends since kindergarten! Just amazing to see these young ladies grow up!”</p><p>Many are convinced Dakota is her mom’s twin. The youngster’s fierceness when taking pictures reminds dozens of Girlfriends fans of Golden’s character, Maya Denise Wilkes, on the hit television show. Brooks recently spoke with the press about how she used her mother’s tenacity to channel Maya’s spirit.</p><p>“Growing up she was such a strong force,” Golden shared during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Hey Black Mom</a>. “She had different levels of anger and seriousness, and I feel like Maya is kinda the same,” the celebrity mom said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2022/09/golden-Brooks3.jpg alt width=640 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I think it’s important for Pop culture — the movies, and film and TV — to continue to find ways to celebrate and shed light and to portray Black motherhood and what that means,” Golden shared with the press.</p><p>“I didn’t want to make that part of Maya that Black motherhood stereotype because there is a certain image that we think of when we think of Black mamas and their sons and Black mamas and their daughters,” <a href=# rel=noopener>the actress</a> continued. “I really wanted to show a little bit of that humor in there along with her tenacity to make her son better, even no matter what her (sic) and Darnell were going through.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2022/09/golden-Brooks2.jpg alt width=640 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Girlfriends went for eight seasons before ending in 2008.
