It will be performed by Brendan Murray, who is known for previously being in the band HomeTown.</p><p>The song was co-written by Swedish Grammy- nominated songwriter Jörgen Elofsson and James Newman, a British songwriter. It is described by Brendan as a love song and also a power ballad. Jörgen Elofsson has previously written songs for the likes of Westlife and Britney Spears. The first play of the song was on the Nicky Byrne Show on Friday morning.</p><p></p><p>It was Brendan’s first solo video shoot but he says that he is proud to be representing his country and cannot wait to perform on the Eurovision stage.</p><p>Brendan has Louis Walsh behind him as his mentor for the competition. When speaking with RTE he said, “I chose Brendan Murray because he is an amazing singer and his voice is so unique, I’ve never heard anyone like him before” and we definitely have to agree with Louis on that!</p><p>Brendan will be performing ‘Dying to Try’ on The Late Late show next month. He will then make his way to Kyiv to perform on the Eurovision stage.</p><p>Ireland last won Eurovision in 1996 which was the year Brendan was born in. So does he have what it takes?</p><p>What do you think of Ireland’s entry of ‘Dying to Try’?
