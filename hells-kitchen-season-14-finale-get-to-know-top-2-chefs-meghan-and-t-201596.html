Two women remain as Hell’s Kitchen Season 14 prepares to crown a winner. <strong>Meghan Gill</strong>, 28, and <strong>T Gregoire</strong>, 31, are the last chefs standing in the latest season of Fox’s reality cooking competition, and they both spoke to <strong>Us Weekly</strong> about their time on the show.</p><p><strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong> will choose one of the finalists for a head chef position in a restaurant at Caesars Atlantic City. Before one of the women claims her new title, find out everything you need to know about each of the up-and-coming young chefs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Meghan Gill</strong></p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p><p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Roanoke, Va.</p><p><strong>What Being on TV is Like:</strong> “It’s terrifying to watch yourself on television. You have no idea what you said. I discovered that I may have a mouth on me! The terrifying mom calls are the worst. Oh boy. ‘What did you say?'”</p><p><strong>Training: </strong>French</p><p><strong>Expertise: </strong>French-based Mediterranean cuisine</p><p><strong>Why Hell’s Kitchen?</strong> “It’s actually out of my character to take that kind of a risk but I’m not not happy that I did it.”</p><p><strong>Culinary Idol:</strong> “I would have to say the person who taught me how to cook, <strong>Jon Mathieson</strong>. He can do no wrong in my book. He taught me basically everything I know. He yelled at me when I needed to be yelled at, he encouraged me when I needed to be encouraged. When I was getting ready to throw in the towel at 24 he yelled at me until he knocked some sense into me. He really pushed me.”</p><p><strong>Her Strengths:</strong> “I’ve said that I have blinders on, but I think that is one of my strengths. I am very focused. I have a solid background. I believe that I can cook very well as a line cook. I believe that I can be a leader in the kitchen. I have a voice and a purpose in the kitchen, and direction.”</p><p><strong>Biggest Threat From T:</strong> “She was like a dark horse. Now that I’m watching it on TV, I really see her strengths and I see how she grew throughout the competition. I think that it blindsided me a little bit when we got into the black jackets and I was back in the kitchen with her and I was like, ‘Wait a minute!’ She’d really progressed.”</p><p><strong>Girl Power: </strong>“I would not have gone into this competition not thinking I was going to be the winner. I think everybody thinks that!”</p><p><strong>Non-Culinary Hobbies:</strong> “I like shopping! I love to go to places where there is water. I don’t necessarily get in the water, but I like to relax and kick back. You’re in the kitchen all the time and it’s so intense all the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>T Gregoire</strong></p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 31</p><p><strong>Hometown: </strong>Atlanta, Ga.</p><p><strong>What Being on TV is Like: </strong>“Sometimes it’s weird listening to something that I’ve said. The best part is seeing my own facial expressions.”</p><p><strong>Training:</strong> French</p><p><strong>Why Hell’s Kitchen?</strong> “This show was sort of like a moment of validation for me. I really wanted to know if this was something I still want to consider doing. If you want to be the best, you still have to go where the best go, play with the best, and surround yourself with them. I felt like this competition embodied that.”</p><p><strong>Culinary Idol: </strong>“Gordon of course is very inspirational to me, but the people who have worked really closely with me, my mentors, Chef <strong>Jonathan [Jerusalmy]</strong> and Chef <strong>Veronica [Wandui]</strong>, they’ve really molded me into the person and the chef that I’ve become today.”</p><p><strong>Her Strengths:</strong> “I’ve learned so much to pay more attention to detail. It is all in the detail and that is something that really held me back, even as a young cook.”</p><p><strong>Biggest Threat From Meghan: </strong>“Meghan is a very talented chef, and she’s already an executive chef. Me, as a line cook, I’m not as experienced in the industry as she is. She has more technique than me, but I have the passion!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Girl Power:</strong> “It was just about getting the guys up out of there! But I think women have been winning the last couple of seasons. I was really excited I could actually be one of those women.”</p><p><strong>Non-Culinary Hobbies: </strong>“Definitely at the top of my list has to be sleeping! Number two has to be laundry, and then spending time with the family. I love my family, but after spending time with them at the end of the day I have to go back to work and then I have no clean chef jackets! What am I gonna do then? Right now I am on a knowledge thirst so I’m reading a couple of things. In order to develop in this industry you have to know your stuff.”</p><p>Hell’s Kitchen will name a winner on Tuesday, June 9, at 9 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOoZylpKNiuKrAwqGcp2Wjmq60u81maG1llp67orjEZp6erF2pvG63zaiuZqyfpXpzecKhnJ%2BrXaKyqLTAp2SappRiwW5%2Bj2pscm4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
