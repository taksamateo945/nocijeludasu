"I'll always have a spot in my heart for him and I'll always love him like a brother and wish him nothing but the best."</p><p>The changes in Buffalo have been comprehensive. Key veterans from past iterations of the team like cornerback Tre'Davious White, safety Jordan Poyer and center Mitch Morse were all cut in cost-cutting moves to help the Bills navigate a bloated salary sheet.</p><p>Wide receiver Deonte Harty, special-teamer Siran Neal and running back Nyheim Hines were also released, both Von Miller and Allen had their contracts restructured and Diggs was moved. Additionally, wide receiver Gabe Davis departed in free agency.</p><p>The Bills did re-sign safety Taylor Rapp, extended slot corner Taron Johnson and made <a href=# rel=noopener>incoming moves</a> around the roster. But this is a team that will go into the 2024 season with a far different look.</p><p>"I guess that's the nature of the business," Allen said. "And going into Year 7 now, it just kind of is what it is. I don't get paid to make changes on the team, I get paid to be the best quarterback that I can be and try to lead the guys on this team."</p><p>One of the concerns is a potential lack of playmakers in the passing game, with both Diggs and Davis now gone, though the Bills did sign Curtis Samuel and Mack Hollins. Neither is anywhere near the level of Diggs, however, who was a Pro Bowler in all four of his seasons with the Bills.</p><p>But Allen said he's looking forward to working with the pair of Samuel and Hollins alongside remaining weapons like Khalil Shakir, Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox.</p><p>"Within the system, anybody can get the ball at any given time," he told reporters. "These guys are very excited for that. They're working extremely hard. It's good to see those guys here and getting to know some of these younger guys better. And looking forward to getting to know them as best as I can so we can use that on the field."</p><p>More than likely, the Bills will add to their receiver room during the NFL draft. But Allen is going to have to make do with a grouping of weapons that likely will be far less dynamic than his offerings in seasons past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyCc3yMm6ClpKNit7C%2Fx2aYpaSVo3qquMtmmKWvka7AbrTAr5xmmV2ovbDAjKKlZqWpYrWmrdGtZJ%2BnomLAtbHFqKVmnJmctLR5wJ%2Brnqpdqb%2BisMQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
