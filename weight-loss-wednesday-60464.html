She has since shed an impressive 56 pounds!</p><p>“Now that I have lost the weight, my self-esteem is higher than it has ever been,” Kim, 50, exclusively told ‘Closer Weekly.’ “I feel that I have my life back!”</p><p>Read on to find out how Kim successfully lost the weight and turned her life around!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kim-before-weight-loss.jpg><p>Kimberly before her 56 pound weight loss.</p><ul><li>What was your life like before the weight loss?</li></ul><p>My life before my weight loss was very depressing. I was very insecure with myself, had very low self-esteem, [was] tired all the time and never wanted to participate in any [social] events.</p><ul><li>Was there a specific moment that triggered your desire to lose weight?</li></ul><p>My weight took a turn for the worse when I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. The constant exhaustion lead to rapid weight gain. Once I finally got the disease under control, I decided I was tired of feeling overweight and sad [and] had to take control of my life! I was way too young to be feeling the way that I was feeling. I wanted to be able to enjoy my grandchildren and family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kim-weight-loss-split.jpg><p>Before weight loss, left. After, right. (Photo Credits: Nutrisystem)</p><ul><li>How did you get started on your weight loss journey?</li></ul><p>I [often saw] Marie Osmond on Nutrisystem commercials and I thought if [the program] worked for Marie and other individuals, then it has to work [for me too]! I started with Nutrisystem’s vegetarian line, and now eat meals and snacks eight to nine times per day. I make healthier food choices and keep all of my portion sizes under control. I work out six to seven days each week by incorporating weight training along with cardio exercises.</p><p><a href=#>Related Story: Bryn Lost More Than 80 Pounds by Cutting Out Junk Food!</a></p><ul><li>What advice would you give to others looking to lose a substantial amount of weight?</li></ul><p>I [would] recommend the <a href=#>Nutrisystem</a> program [because it] provides the education needed for the correct nutritional foundation and doesn’t deprive you of any foods. I didn’t feel like I was on a diet because I was eating all the time! Learning how to eat correctly and incorporating daily exercise makes me feel wonderful all day long. I have more energy and stamina than I had at 20 years of age. I am more confident and very proud of my weight loss results!</p><p>To submit your own weight loss story, email <a href=#>jbirkinbine@bauerxcel.com</a>.</p><p>Want to win a six month Nutrisystem membership?
