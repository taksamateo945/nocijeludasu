The former player played for different teams and currently serves as the Chicago Bulls’ vice president of basketball operations. During his time at the University of Notre Dame, he was an All-American.</p><p>John’s professional career is not his only tale of success. He has been happily married for several years now to <strong>Carolyn Paxson</strong>. As he has remained in the limelight over the years, many must be intrigued to know about his marriage. So, here we present this short article about John Paxson’s wife and some details about her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_And_Carolyns_Marital_Life></span>John And Carolyn’s Marital Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Carolyn Paxson is John Paxson’s wife. The couple must have been married for quite some time now. But, since the duo has not revealed much information about their first meeting and how their relationship started, their wedding details also remain scarce. Nonetheless, it must have been a lovely private affair attended by friends and families.</p><p>Over the years, the pair’s marriage has grown stronger than ever. Let’s hope Mr. and Mrs. Paxson soon reveal more about their marital life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Welcomed_Two_Children_Together></span>Welcomed Two Children Together<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, it must have been several years since Carolyn and John walked down the aisle. In all these years of being together, the lovebirds welcomed <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>two children</a>.</p><p>In 1986, John Paxson’s wife, Carolyn, gave birth to their eldest child, <strong>Ryan Paxson</strong>. Likewise, <strong>Drew Paxson</strong> is their youngest, whose birth details have not been revealed. Carolyn Paxson’s children with John have already grown up and are currently busy in their respective careers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Carolyn-Paxson-with-husband-and-son.jpg><p>Ryan is in the Marines, and since August 2021, he has been serving as a Sergeant Instructor at Quantico, Virginia. On the other hand, Drew is a Business Operations Assistant at Chicago Bulls. All in all, Carolyn and her hubby must be proud of what their boys have achieved so far.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Know About George Foreman’s Ex-Wife Andrea Skeete</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Of_The_Four_Children_Of_Her_Parents></span>One Of The Four Children Of Her Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Paxson’s spouse was born <strong>Carolyn Ziehler</strong>. She was welcomed by <strong>Grace Marilyn Ziehler</strong> and <strong>John Robert Ziehler</strong>. She grew up in her hometown with her siblings, <strong>Maryellen Hause, Robert Joseph Ziehler</strong>, and <strong>Margaret Ziehler</strong>. Sadly, Carolyn’s siblings, Robert and Margaret have already passed away.</p><p>Furthermore, Carolyn Paxson’s dad <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">previously owned</a> Producers Oil Company. Unfortunately, he passed away on January 30, 2016. Tragedy struck her again after four months when her beloved <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mama died</a> on May 3, 2016. It must have been difficult for her to deal with the demise of her parents in such a short interval. But, as they say, life moves on no matter what; she now must be doing well.</p><p>As <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">per&nbsp;Dayton Daily News</a>, John Paxson’s other half attended Alter High. Other than that, she has kept information about her education and professional career a secret.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carolyn_And_John_Sold_Their_Home></span>Carolyn And John Sold Their Home<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In November 2019, the husband and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">wife sold their</a> Lake Bluff house for $725,000. While doing so, the couple made a 10 percent return after they had owned the home for almost three decades. In addition, the pair had listed their home in December 2018 for $1.08 million, which is $137,222 less than the original purchase price as per today’s dollars.</p><p>Then, in early May, the lovebirds lowered the price to $999,900, followed by $979,000 at the end of May. After that, they lowered the price throughout the summer, and in August, it was $799,000, which is 33 percent less than the original asking price. And finally, they sold it for $725,000.</p><p>Moreover, the pair bought the home in 19991 for $650,000, which would be $1.22 million in today’s dollars. The 5,200-square-foot home was built in 1990, and it has five bedrooms, six baths, and other features.</p><p>In addition, despite being in the limelight, Mrs. Paxson seems to be a low-key person. She is not active on social media and has not shared much about herself. Nonetheless, Carolyn must be doing well. We wish her blissful days ahead.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLbOoaVmqJGtwLC6jLCgn51dmK6zu8uypWaoka3AsLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
