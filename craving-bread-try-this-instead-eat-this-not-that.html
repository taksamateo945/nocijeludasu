However, certain carbs (such as specific types of bread) can wreak havoc on your waistline, blood sugar, and other health issues. While bread is a carb that can certainly fit into a healthy diet, you may still be seeking out alternatives when a craving hits. When seeking out these healthier alternatives to wheat bread, you want to look for options that don’t contain tons of sugar, fat, salt, and more unhealthy ingredients.</p><p>When you’re really in need of a good piece of bread, or something similar, what should you go for? We spoke with <strong>Amy Shapiro, MS, RD</strong> about her top recommendations for a bread swap.</p><p>Her first selection is <strong>grain-free bread</strong>.<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>“Enjoying a grain-free bread that toasts up and tastes like bread but is made from almond flour will fill you up and prevent blood sugar spikes,” says Shapiro.</p><p>Another benefit of opting for grain-free bread besides blood sugar management is potentially helping manage inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Plus, grain-free bread is also a great option for those who are gluten-free. This is because certain grains are sources of gluten. Gluten is a protein that can cause digestive discomfort in sensitive individuals. Therefore, going grain-free can reduce the risk of potential digestive issues.</p><p>If you are making the switch to grain-free bread, a few of Shapiro’s favorite brands include Base Culture, Unbun, Siete Foods Tortillas, and Plantiful Kitchen.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><br>Sign up for our newsletter!</p><p>However, if grain-free bread isn’t cutting it for you, Shapiro has another option: <strong>switching to healthier carbs</strong>.</p><p>“If you are craving carbs but you don’t want bread, which often contains additional ingredients and can be highly processed, I recommend enjoying healthier carbohydrates like whole grains such as rice, quinoa, and farro, sweet potato, and potato,” says Shapiro.</p><p>According to Shapiro, this can give your body what it is craving and fill that void.</p><p>Selecting other&nbsp;whole grains is a great alternative to white bread because it contains three parts of the grain, it is all nutrient-rich, and fiber-filling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png><p>When it comes to sweet potatoes, they are great for keeping you full and energized longer because they’re digested slowly. Similar to whole grains, sweet potatoes are loaded with fiber. They also contain nutrients and are great for fat-burning thanks to their high vitamin content. The vitamins consist of A, C, and B6.</p><p>Also, similar to grain-free bread, these swaps may help stabilize blood-sugar levels due to their antioxidant properties coming from carotenoids. These options may also lower insulin resistance.</p><p>By making these switches, you are not only benefiting your body in more ways in one, but you’re crushing those cravings at the source. So, next time you’re thinking about grabbing a slice of unhealthy bread, think about what else you can eat, instead!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vCq5ivoZ6ceqO%2BxJqbZqyirnq1tMisZKKmo6myorCMnpitZaSdtrR5zairZqyYlsFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
