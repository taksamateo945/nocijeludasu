It didn't look like McIlroy could get anything going up until the 17th hole where he holed a long birdie putt and gave a confident fist pump.</p><p>Jason Day failed to compete with McIlroy, shooting an even par 72. Day had his share of birdies all day, however, he also backed them up with bogeys.&nbsp;</p><p>He is now in a tie for second with three other competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>There were a couple big movers on this Saturday, however.&nbsp;</p><p>The champion in 2009, Angel Cabrera, shot a 67 to climb all the way into a tie for second place.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Cabrera already owns a jacket, he can be very dangerous tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>South African Charl Schwartzel shot a 68 and also moved into a tie for second.</p><p>Adam Scott also climbed his way back into the tournament.&nbsp;He fired a 67 and remains only five shots off the lead. &nbsp;</p><p>Luke Donald shot a third-round 69 to get to seven-under for the tournament and five shots off McIlroy.&nbsp;</p><p>Bubba Watson climbed the leaderboard substantially today, going from even to five-under with a 67. He, however, remains a long shot and will require a spectacular round on Sunday for a victory.&nbsp;</p><p>After the spectacular round on Friday, <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> could not find any consistency with his putter. He shot a 74. He will need a great round tomorrow to fight his way back into contention. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a> needed a big round today to get back into contention. This did not happen, however, Mickelson shot a 71 and remains nine shots off the lead. He will need a minor miracle for his fourth green jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaderboard for this year's Masters has many great stories, Sunday should be a spectacular afternoon of golf. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobW5xZ2iBbrnArKueqqNif3F9kGajnpmUmr%2Bju8Crm2acka56dHnAZpqoraChsm67xWaqmqylp7GixYympq%2Bdoqh6orrDZqqhmZuav7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
