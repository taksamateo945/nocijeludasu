It was assumed that if someone didn’t wake up to that there was little to no risk of premature internment.</p><p>Just in case, inventors jumped at the chance to design “safety coffins”, many of which were equipped with horns or bells (where the term “saved by the bell” comes from) which could alert people above ground that the, uh, corpse was not actually dead. Some models even had a stash of poison just in case the person figured out they wouldn’t be saved and wanted to die a little quicker.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-44367 alt="Catalepsy Womoan" width=350 height=509 data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/woman—catalepsy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-44367 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>WordPress</a></p><p>No one actually knows if these measures did save anyone, but it certainly quelled anxiety, which served both a social and medicinal purpose.</p><p>While it would be many more years before catatonia was understood, oddly enough as a state induced by hypnosis, our modern day understanding of it means that being buried alive is a rarity. Catalepsy, on the other hand, is actually relatively common and is now understood to fall into the category of REM sleep disorders like narcolepsy.</p><p>People who experience the state–either as part of drug withdrawals, schizophrenia or other disorders–can take medication and practice relaxation techniques that help them live a basically normal life; no longer must they fear the (early) reaper.</p><p>For more on the unbelievable medical conditions and treatments of yesteryear, check out these <a href=#>haunting images of Victorian mental asylums</a> and <a href=#>the brutally painful treatments of the Middle Ages</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykrdOao56oo658cw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
