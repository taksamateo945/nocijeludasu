On Thursday, Aug. 15, the Modern Family actress' older brother, <strong>Jimmy Workman</strong>, filed documents in L.A. asking the court to remove Winter, 15, from sister <strong>Shanelle Gray</strong>'s care and award custody to him instead, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports.</p><p>According to the site, Workman says in the papers that Gray is a bad role model who "exploits Ariel's fame and money to promote her acting school." He also alleges that Gray has a history with drugs, mishandles their sister's money, and is poisoning Winter against her mother, <strong>Chrystal Workman</strong>, and the rest of the family.</p><p>"The allegations are nothing new," Gray's lawyer told TMZ. "We will handle them in court. Shanelle has taken excellent care of Ariel to date. It's interesting how Jimmy and Chrystal talk about repairing their fractured family, and then make allegations like this."</p><p>Winter has been living with her older sister since late last year, after she was removed from her mother's home in November 2012 amid allegations of physical and emotional abuse. Both Chrystal and Jimmy Workman denied the allegations, but Gray was granted temporary guardianship anyway.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actress' mom recently filed documents asking for custody to be restored to her, but a judge <a href=#>denied the request</a>. Gray's guardianship was extended, and another custody trial will be held in September.</p><p>Winter, for her part, has said she's happy living with her sister. "My life is definitely more normal â€” and that'll help me grow up like I'm supposed to," she told Teen Vogue in March. "Like, I always wanted to be a dancer, and now I'm taking dance classes. And I didn't have many friends. It was all about work. Nowadays, my sister's like, 'You're supposed to have friends. You're supposed to go out on Friday and Saturday nights.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJiroZWheri1za2cq6tdl7%2BwwMeeqWaimaK6unnWqKmkpZGjerSxxKSqZpulqMGwsNhmpp9lnaSxpr7NZp2apZmhxm6%2F05qpZmpgZoBygpc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
