"For Mr. Trump, I have only one word," the former first lady <a href=#>wrote in Spanish</a> with a bold red message featuring one simple focal point: "Basta!" (The word means "enough.")</p><p dir=ltr lang=es>"Para el Señor Trump, solo tengo una palabra." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7CJnin3aGh</a></p><p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=#>July 13, 2015</a></p><p>She reiterated the message while <a href=#>addressing a cheering crowd</a> on Monday in Kansas City. "It was appalling to hear Donald Trump describe immigrants as drug dealers, racists, and criminals," the Democratic party front-runner said of Trump's controversial remarks at his campaign kickoff event last month. (At the event, Trump said: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best… They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." The business mogul was subsequently dumped by NBCUniversal and other business ventures after inciting outrage.)</p><p>Clinton called out the insensitivity of his statements. "He’s talking about people you and I know," she expressed. "He’s talking about people who love this country, work hard, and want nothing more than a chance to build a better life for themselves and this country."</p><p>Clinton pointed out that Trump, 69, has yet to express any form of remorse for his statements. "When people and businesses everywhere rejected his hateful comments, did he apologize?" she asked. "No, he doubled down."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bill Clinton's wife also called out the many other Republican candidates who have remained largely silent amidst Trump's continual remarks about illegal immigration. "And to all the other Republicans running for president, why did it take weeks for most of you to speak out?" Clinton asked on Monday. "The sad truth is even if some of the other candidates now condemn those words, if you look at many of their policies, it's hard to tell the difference."</p><p>Trump has amassed a continual list of enemies as his campaign for the U.S. presidency continues, including the wrath of one notorious criminal. The entrepreneur <a href=#>drew the ire of drug cartel leader<strong> El Chapo</strong></a>, who escaped from prison this past weekend, after the mogul vented his frustrations via Twitter. In response, El Chapo directly threatened Trump.</p><p>"Continue f—ing around and I will make you swallow all your whore words f—ing white [slur for those with blond or red hair]," El Chapo wrote in a tweet to Trump on Sunday. Trump told TMZ on Monday that the FBI has been alerted following El Chapo's threats. "I'm fighting for the future of our country, which is being overrun by criminals," he told the site. "You can't be intimidated. It's too important."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BipJyWv7p5wqWgp6yfo3qntdGeqmaakZi4bq3TZpuoppGhsW7A0a6kqWWZo3q0vMCnoKygXZeutMDAZmlpaWVmgHg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
