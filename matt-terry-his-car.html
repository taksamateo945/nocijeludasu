The former X Factor winner realises the struggles he faced and he is sorry for hiding their relationship from others. The heartfelt lyrics will resonate with many members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>Matt co-wrote his touching new single with Xoro (Tim Kulawik) who also produced the track. The official music video, which serves a perfect visual embodiment of the song, was directed by Matt with fashion photographer and filmmaker Courtney Nathan Phillip.</p><p>Recounting his journey of self-discovery, Matt Terry said: “I came on to the music scene in 2016 where my sexuality was the forefront of every conversation. Protecting myself I walked away to discover myself naturally and privately. As a young man without any experience in that area of life, how was I supposed to tell anybody who I was if I didn’t know myself?</p><p>“Today I know exactly who I am and I absolutely love the human I have become. With this story of mine I want to uplift and shine light on a huge part of the LGTBQ community that aren’t as present in our music industry or media. This song is an apology to the first man I ever loved. I asked him to keep our relationship under wraps for many years. This one is for your everyday boy next door falling in love with another.“</p><p>‘His Car’ is now available <a href=#>here</a> on all digital platforms. By telling his story, Matt will no doubt help many people to embrace who they are. It’s important to remember that everyone has their own journey and coming out should always be done on one’s own terms.</p><p>With his latest releases, it’s clear that Matt Terry has not only found out who he is as a person but also as an artist. His new music connects on a truly deep level. ‘His Car’ follows ‘<a href=#>You Don’t Know Nothing</a>‘ and ‘<a href=#>Ghost of Me</a>‘ as Matt’s third independent single.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of ‘His Car’ by Matt Terry?
