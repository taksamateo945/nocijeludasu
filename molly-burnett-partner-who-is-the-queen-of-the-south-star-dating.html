She has also appeared in other shows like Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, and Law & Order: SVU. But what about her personal life? Who is Molly Burnett’s partner?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Molly Burnett’s Relationship History</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, Molly Burnett has only been publicly linked to two men in the past 13 years. In 2008, she dated actor Aaron Hill, who has had minor roles in shows like Breaking Bad, Gilmore Girls, and The Middle. They broke up in 2009.</p><p>Shortly after the split, Burnett started dating her on-screen boyfriend from Days of Our Lives, Casey Jon Deidrick. They were together for about two years before calling it quits in 2011.</p><p>Since then, Burnett has not been romantically involved with anyone, at least publicly. She seems to be focused on her career and enjoying her single life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Molly Burnett’s Partner in Crime</h2><p>However, that does not mean that Burnett does not have a partner in crime. On her Instagram account, she often posts pictures of herself with her Queen of the South co-star Hemky Madera, who plays Pote Galvez on the show.</p><p>The two have a great chemistry on and off the screen, as they portray a couple who work for Teresa Mendoza (Alice Braga), the queen of the drug cartel. Fans love their unlikely pairing and root for them to stay together.</p><p>But before you get your hopes up, there is nothing romantic going on between Burnett and Madera. According to Gossip Next Door, Madera is happily married to his partner, Jesse Lynn Madera, a singer and songwriter. They have two children together and live in Los Angeles.</p><p>Burnett and Madera are just good friends and co-workers who enjoy each other’s company and support each other’s careers. Burnett calls Madera her “partner in crime” in a platonic way, not a romantic one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Molly Burnett’s Future Plans</h2><p>So, who is Molly Burnett’s partner? The answer is no one, at least for now. The actress is single and not looking for love at the moment. She is busy with her work and her hobbies, such as singing, producing, and traveling.</p><p>Burnett has a lot of projects lined up for the future. She is set to return for the sixth and final season of Queen of the South, which will premiere in 2024. She is also working on a new movie called The Last Resort, a comedy about a group of friends who go on a vacation to a remote island.</p><p>Burnett is also passionate about raising awareness and funds for various causes, such as animal welfare, mental health, and environmental issues. She is an ambassador for the Humane Society of the United States and a supporter of the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p>Burnett is a talented and versatile actress who has a lot to offer to the entertainment industry and the world. She does not need a partner to complete her or define her. She is happy and fulfilled on her own. And who knows, maybe one day, she will find someone who shares her values and vision. But until then, she is enjoying her life as a single and successful woman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6K8rbjYZpmuqp6awbV5z5qpraaVp3q4tM5moKxlpJ2ybr3UnpynZZ%2BberW0xGaqqK2knXq0wMCrZJ2ZpJ67qHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
