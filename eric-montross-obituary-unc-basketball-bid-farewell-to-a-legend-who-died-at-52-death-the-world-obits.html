He was a beloved figure to Tar Heel Sports Network viewers for 18 seasons as he shared his knowledge, enthusiasm, and humor with them. Because Montross fought for causes he believed in, his influence went well beyond the basketball world. Reflecting his commitment to making a significant impact on people’s lives, he actively supported the Lineberger Center’s fight against cancer.</p><p>In a touching tribute, Carolina Athletics remembered Montross for all he did as a dedicated family man, friend, and community leader. In it, Montross expressed the feelings of the many people whose lives he touched with his hospitality, generosity, and genuine kindness. Thanks to everyone who showed their support during Eric’s brave fight with cancer, the Montross family was able to release a statement expressing their gratitude.</p><p>They asked for privacy at this difficult time to pay tribute to a man whose grace and unfaltering resolve touched many lives.
