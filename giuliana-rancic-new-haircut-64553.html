The beautiful television personality just posted a mysterious photo on Instagram hinting at an upcoming project. Fans of the star will remember that in 2015 she announced she was leaving her position as co-anchor on E! News — a position she’d held for nearly a decade — in order to pursue other opportunities. Although she continued to appear on Fashion Police, we’ve all been wondering what she’s been doing with all her free time.</p><p>The celebrity journalist has her husband, Bill, and her son, Duke, to keep her hands full but it looks like she’s also been working on some under-the-radar projects. Could it be a new show? Another restaurant? Or possibly the star is venturing into a new field she’s yet to try? <strong>Watch the video below to see what Giuliana shared with fans!</strong></p><p>Obviously, fans were excited to find out that Giuliana is making a return to the spotlight. The comment section on her latest Instagram is full of predictions for what’s to come! “Hopefully it’s a daily scheduled TV show. I miss watching you every day…” one fan wrote. While another added, “I wish you’d bring back Giuliana & Bill, I miss your show so much!”</p><p>It’s clear that the 43-year-old has a strong fan base. And while the chances that she’s bringing back her old reality show (which went off the air in 2014) is unlikely, she could be working on a new reality show. Honestly, we’re just happy that Giuliana is healthy enough to pursue new ventures after her battle with breast cancer.</p><p>“I was diagnosed at 36 years old. No family history of breast cancer. It was the most shocking moment of my life,” she previously revealed to <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a> in an exclusive interview. “I remember the words ‘this too shall pass.’ And it does pass. Just knowing that there is a light at the end of the tunnel is what we need to get us through the day.” We’re so happy she found the light at the end of the tunnel — and we can’t wait to see what it holds!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8airKWhkaOubr7Ap5qim12jsrh5x5qgq5ulqXp3gJRuag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
