Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along, however we were overly excited to shared the good news.”</p><p>Their statement continued, <span>“Our love for each other is our strength. We will continue trying to expand our beautiful family. We are grateful for all of your support. We kindly ask for privacy during this difficult moment.”</span></p><p>In the comments, Sam had some reassuring words for his fiancée, writing, “We will have a miracle soon ❤️.”</p><p>Britney first revealed to fans that she and Asghari were “having a baby” last month, following their vacation to Hawaii.</p><p>“I lost so much weight to go on my Maui trip only to gain it back… I thought ‘Geez… what happened to my stomach ???,’” she wrote at the time. “My husband said ‘No you’re food pregnant silly!!!’ So I got a pregnancy test… and uhhhhh well… I am having a baby…”</p><p>Spears is a mom to sons Sean Preston, 16,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jayden James, 15 with ex-husband Kevin Federline. She began dating Asghari, a personal trainer and actor, after they starred together in her “Slumber Party” music video back in 2016. They&nbsp;announced their engagement in September, shortly before her conservatorship was terminated&nbsp;in November.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm6mirJ6axm6%2Fz56Yq6tdm7aiusKeZKyZnWKutLPHmqmiZZGju7DBzZycZqyYmsZuuM6sq2asmJq2s3nMoqmam5yaeqOtwbJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
