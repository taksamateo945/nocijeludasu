Donations came pouring in and those who couldn’t donate spread the word on social media to let others know how important this initiative was and how it also showed support to Harry. &nbsp;As the days went on, it was proven that undoubtedly, there is no fan base more generous, supportive, and loving than that of One Direction.</p><p>In addition to the fans, Harry’s mom Anne also posted about the campaign on her Twitter on multiple occasions and she agreed to be a judge in the art competition that the Skylark IX Recovery Trust set up. Over 250 people entered their artwork in the competition and the winners will be announced on Monday. &nbsp;In addition to her spreading the word and assisting with the competition, she gave the final donation to the initiative; she’s a wonderful woman.</p><p>At the campaign’s end, £6000 was raised to save Skylark and in addition to saving the little ship, the campaign will also touch the lives of those who have suffered from addiction. &nbsp;The trust works closely with Alternatives, a group that works with addicts on their way to recovery and they’ve already begun restructuring Skylark.</p><p>So what happens next for Skylark? Restoration continues until the lottery bid is worked out and hopefully by the 80th anniversary of Operation Dynamo, the Miracle of Dunkirk, Skylark will be able to sail with the other Dunkirk Little Ships.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who donated to the campaign, you not only supported Harry, you helped preserve a piece of history and you should be proud.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ks6K60mafmqqirnq0wNilnKxlo6q%2Fsa3SrGScmZ2lrqqzzWaeqJmcYsCiwsRmqqSxnJa%2FrHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
