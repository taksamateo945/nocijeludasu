Santa Anita officials have touted safety improvements that have brought down the annual number of fatalities since 2019, when 42 horses died at the track, sparking widespread debate about safety issues at Santa Anita and about horse racing in general."</i></p><p>Practical Move, a three-year-old colt, won the Grade II San Felipe Stakes in March and the Grade I Santa Anita Derby in April.
