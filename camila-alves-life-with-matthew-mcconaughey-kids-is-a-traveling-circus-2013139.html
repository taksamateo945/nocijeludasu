We’re a traveling circus,” Alves tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>Most recently, the brood moved from their California home base to New Orleans while McConaughey, 43, filmed Dallas Buyers Club. Though she admits constant travel can get hectic, Alves tells <strong>Us</strong> she loves the sense of adventure and the culture it affords her children. “Levi and Vida get to see and experience so much culture. We call ourselves the trailblazers,” she says. (One other recent pit-stop for Levi, Vida and their little brother: New York City, where Alves indulged their creativity at the city’s Children’s Museum of Art.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Being on the road so frequently allows the McConaughey siblings to really bond. Beams proud mom Alves of her three little ones: “Levi and Vida are best friends and they’re just great with Livingston — they love to take care of him.”</p><p>Regardless of where the family is, they pitch in on chores — even the kids! “[The kids] know that work is a part of everyday life. They have their responsibilities: Levi has to go get the mail and feed the dog — and if they want a certain toy, they have to work for it,” says Alves, who issues her two older children a small allowance for a job well done.</p><p>Realizing that she may catch flak for putting her tykes to work around the house, Alves says she’s just trying to prepare her children for later in life. “They make their own beds, fold their own clothes. They get proud of being accomplished. It’s not perfect, but they’re into it!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJqapZmhrm6ty6%2BcrGWcnrOmedaiq6FlnZbBtbTEsGSmm5Oku6LBxqGcsmWbnrG0ecisZJplpKeut7HLoqWgZZOev6TB0mZpaWljZoB6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
